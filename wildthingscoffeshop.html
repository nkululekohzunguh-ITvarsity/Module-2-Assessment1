          <h3>WILD THINGS COFFEE SHOP </h3>
         <p>The Coffee Shop is a place where customers become regulars and regulars become friends. We are your home away from home, the place where you’ll always get more and more.

We’ve gone the extra mile to bring you all your familiar favourites as well as the latest food innovations and seasonal meals. Each plate is generously stacked with fresh ingredients of the highest quality so that you can enjoy more of that nutritious taste.

We’re serious about coffee and we take care to hand select the best single origin beans and international blends from the finest coffee producing regions all over the world. Then we roast them locally before our professionally trained baristas pour the perfect cappuccino, just for you. Want more? Order a Bottomless coffee or cold drink and find an excuse to stay a while longer.

When it comes to decadent treats, we’ve been baking every cake, cookie, muffin and croissant from scratch in each of our restaurants since day one. Some of our recipes have even been in use for over 20 years, because there’s no point in meddling with perfection.Ou</p>
